<p>Cricket has been more than just a pastime for me—it’s been a journey of dedication and growth. Initially, I was an average player, not taking the sport too seriously until around 8th grade. That’s when something clicked; I realized that with focused practice, I could elevate my game. I started dedicating more time to my batting skills, honing my timing and technique, and worked consistently on my bowling as well. Though I’m best known for my skills as a batsman, I developed into a reliable spin bowler too, making me an all-rounder on the field.</p>
<p>After months of rigorous practice, I got the chance to represent my school in competitions, a huge milestone for me. I remember one match in particular, where everything came together—I scored well, bowled effectively, and ultimately played a key role in our victory. I was honored to be named 'Man of the Match,' and it was a moment that validated all the effort I’d put in. Cricket taught me the rewards of discipline and persistence, and it’s a sport that continues to fuel my drive both on and off the field.</p>
