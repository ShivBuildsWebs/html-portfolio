<h1>Gaming</h1>
<hr>
<p>Gaming has been my favorite hobby since childhood, sparking my interest in technology from an early age. I started playing games on my phone, getting lost in various worlds and adventures, which laid the foundation for my love of gaming. As I grew older, I became curious about PCs and the possibilities they offered. My parents noticed my passion and eventually bought me an average PC, which opened up a whole new realm of gaming experiences.</p>

    <p>With my newfound access to a computer, I delved deeper into the gaming world and became fascinated by the technology behind it. I started learning about graphics cards, processors, and how these components work together to create seamless gameplay. As my knowledge expanded, I decided to take the plunge and build my own gaming setup. Researching parts, selecting the right components, and assembling everything was an exhilarating experience.</p>
    
    <p>Creating my own setup not only enhanced my gaming experience but also fueled my passion for technology. It became more than just playing games; it was about understanding and mastering the tech that made it all possible. This journey has shaped my skills and interests, blending my love for gaming with a curiosity for the tech that drives it.</p><br>
