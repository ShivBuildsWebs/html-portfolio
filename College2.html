<p>The General Arts and Science program offered a range of subjects, from humanities and social sciences to foundational science and communications, giving me the chance to explore different areas of study. This breadth helped me identify what truly engaged me, and I soon found that I was naturally drawn to technology. Through projects, group work, and critical thinking exercises, I gained skills that strengthened my adaptability and self-awareness, pushing me to better understand my strengths and interests.</p>

<p>One of the most impactful moments came during a course that involved working with computers and technology. It was here that I discovered a genuine passion for programming and problem-solving. Realizing I could create something functional and purposeful through coding felt like unlocking a new world, and it quickly became clear that this was the direction I wanted to pursue.</p>

<p>Beyond the academics, Niagara College’s vibrant and diverse student community made the experience all the more enriching.
